	<b>What are these manuals?</b>
Some attempt at merging modded manuals into the vanilla manuals that isn't the game's automatically generated PDF (as I've heard complaints that large PDFs are slow, and most of the mod's provided PDFs are outdated in some way). 
I wanted a manual with everything in one place that I could just link to people and it'd have everything they'd need, and nothing more. The Timwi repo is great, but it can give a bit of a sensory overload if you're new. 

This will also aim to alter some appendices, which are all over the place. Appendices often appear multiple times with repeat information across different mods. 
Inversely, some appendices shouldn't be appendices in the first place, because they provide vital information for one module and one module only, and so these get moved to section 1. 
Some other goals are removing fourth wall breaking things, making manuals more printer friendly, and removing excess information refering to non-included mods.
Special thanks to Timwi and crew for providing these manuals in the first place. 
Please report any differences with the original manuals not listed below.

<b>Extensive change and inclusion log:</b>
Vanilla:
* No changes besides some behind the scenes stuff

Vanilla_AlternativeNumbering:
* Pages are numbered in a more future proof way:
-- The introductionory pages are still numbered as before, but without the 'of 23' (eg. "Page 2")
-- Solvable module pages have their numbering prefixed with "1.", starting at "Page 1.1" for the title page.
-- Needy module pages have their numbering prefixed with "2.", starting at "Page 2.1" for the title page.
-- Appendices will have roman numeral page numbering, eg. "Page III".

Modded Manuals:
* By default, besides distinction between solvable, needy & appendix, page ordering will be determined by module release date, similar to how the vanilla manual is not sorted alphabetically either.  
* Changed the introduction pages to account for mods
-- Bombs can have more than 11 modules
-- Bombs can have more than 2 strikes before blowing
-- Not every module can be solved in any order
-- There are more appendices than just A, B and C. Some manuals may not refer to A, B, C but still use it.
* Almost every module:
-- changed the ink blot splatter patterns to not be repetitive in context of the entire manual, and added them where they were missing
-- some BTS changes, such as html tags not being closed, and making stuff work in context of the entire manual
-- page numbering added, changed, to fit with the entire manual.
