				Oh look! Itâ€™s that game that everyone knows of but nobody knows the name of!

			<ul>
				<li>The module has a screen that will display either a circle, a square, or a triangle.</li>
				<li>The screen will display a shape before the module activates. When the module activates, it may display a different shape. Be sure to check the display before then.</li>
				<li>There are also two buttons beneath the screen.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>One button is green and has a checkmark on it. Press it if the shape that is currently being displayed is the same shape as the one that was previously displayed.</li>
					<li>The other is red and has an X on it. Press it if the shape that is currently being displayed is different from the one that was previously displayed.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>A correct button press will add 15 seconds to the timer, up to a maximum of 99 seconds.</li>
				<li>An incorrect button press will record a strike and temporarily disable the module.</li>
				<li>Running out of time will also record a strike and temporarily disable the module.</li>
