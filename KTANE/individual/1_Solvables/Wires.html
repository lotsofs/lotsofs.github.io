        <p class="flavour-text">Wires are the lifeblood of electronics! Wait, no, electricity is the lifeblood. Wires are more like the arteries. The veins? No matter&hellip;</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A wire module can have 3-6 wires on it.</li>
            <li>Only the <em>one</em> correct wire needs to be cut to disarm the module.</li>
            <li>Wire ordering begins with the first on the top.</li>
