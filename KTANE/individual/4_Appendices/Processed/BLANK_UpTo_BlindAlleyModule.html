        <p>You may have noticed that there are some modules which (at least initially) appear blank. At first glance, all modules of this variety are indistinguishable
            <!-- * -->
            . Follow the instructions below in order to determine what module you are looking at.</p>
        <!-- <p class="note">* Note: The module <a href="Hinges.html">Hinges</a> has one or more hinges missing from the module casing, but is otherwise blank.</p> -->
        <ol>
            <!-- <li>Select the module (but do not tap on it).

                    <li>If the module is now highlighted in red, you are looking at <a href="Punctuation%20Marks.html">...?</a>.</li>

                    <li>If you hear a tone, you are looking at <a href="Deaf%20Alley.html">Deaf Alley</a>.</li>

                    <li>If you hear the clicking sound that is played when hovering over a button <b>but do not have any visual feedback</b>, you are looking at Blind Alley. </li>
