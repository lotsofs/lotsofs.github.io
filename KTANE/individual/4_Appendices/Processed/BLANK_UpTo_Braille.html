		<!-- <p class="flavour-text">Somebody at Bomb Corp. got a bit lazy on the graphics.</p> -->

		<p>You may have noticed that there are some modules which (at least initially) appear blank. At first glance, all modules of this variety are indistinguishable<!--*-->. Follow the instructions below in order to determine what module you are looking at.</p>
		<!-- <p>* Note: The module <em>Hinges</em> has one or more hinges missing from the module casing, but is otherwise blank.</p> -->
		<ol>
			<!-- <li>Select the module (but do not tap on it).
				<ul>
					<li>If the module begins to transform, you are looking at <em>The Octadecayotton</em>.</li>
					<li>If the module is now highlighted in red, you are looking at <em>...?</em>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li> -->
			<li>Move the cursor back and forth over the module.
				<ul>
					<li>If the module has patterns of dots on it, you are looking at <em>Braille</em>.</li>
					<!-- <li>If the module has shapes on it, you are looking at <em>Polygons</em>.</li>
					<li>If the module has numbers and a shape on it, you are looking at <em>Hidden In Plain Sight</em>.</li>
					<li>If you hear a tone, you are looking at <em>Deaf Alley</em>.</li>
					<li>If you hear whirring sounds or a printer-like sound, you are looking at <em>Eavesdropping</em>.</li> -->
					<li>If you hear the clicking sound that is played when hovering over a button <b>but do not have any visual feedback</b>, you are looking at <em>Blind Alley</em>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<!-- <li>Press and hold the module.
				<ul>
					<li>If the module shattered like glass, you are looking at <em>A Mistake</em>. It is safe to release at any time.</li>
					<li>If the module begins making ticking noises, you are looking at <em>Tap Code</em>. It is safe to release at any time.</li>
					<li>If two zeroes begin flashing on the module, you are looking at <em>42</em>. <b>DO NOT RELEASE until that module's manual instructs you to do so.</b></li>
					<li>If three zeroes begin flashing on the module, you are looking at <em>501</em>. <b>DO NOT RELEASE until that module's manual instructs you to do so.</b></li>
				</ul>
			</li> -->
