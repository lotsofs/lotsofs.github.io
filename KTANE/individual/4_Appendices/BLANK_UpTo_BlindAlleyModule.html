        <p>You may have noticed that there are some modules which (at least initially) appear blank. At first glance, all modules of this variety are indistinguishable
            <!-- * -->
            . Follow the instructions below in order to determine what module you are looking at.</p>
        <!-- <p class="note">* Note: The module <a href="Hinges.html">Hinges</a> has one or more hinges missing from the module casing, but is otherwise blank.</p> -->
