			<h2>On the Subject of Points of Order</h2>
			<p class="flavour-text" style="margin: .5em 0;">We are playing weird 4-card KTANE Mao. Play begins with me and proceeds in a clockwise direction.</p>
	
			<ul style="margin: .5em 0;">
				<li style="margin: .5em 0;">Welcome to this game of Mao. You joined at just the right time. We’ve already played five cards in accordance with the current rules of the game.</li>
				<li style="margin: .5em 0;">You have four cards on your hand. Once you pick up your cards, you must play a valid card within 5 seconds to defuse the module.</li>
				<li style="margin: .5em 0;">Playing a bad card or failing to play a card within 5 seconds will result in a strike. You will also receive four new cards.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<p style="margin: .5em 0;">
				To find out what the current rules of the game are, examine the cards already played and
				determine which <em>two</em> of the following rules are active and which one is inactive:
			</p>
	
			<style>
				.pointoforder-redsuit {
					font-size: 180%;
					color: red;
				}
				.pointoforder-blacksuit {
					font-size: 180%;
				}
				td.pointoforder-suitrule {
					white-space: nowrap;
					padding: .1em .6em 0;
				}
				.pointoforder-table th {
					text-align: center;
				}
			</style>
	
			<ol>
				<li style="margin: .5em 0;">Examine the first and second character
					of the serial number. Depending on whether each is a letter or a number, the next card’s suit must be one of the following:
					<table class="pointoforder-table">
						<tr><th rowspan='2'>First character</th><th rowspan='2'>Second character</th><th colspan='4'>Previously-played suit</th></tr>
						<tr><th><span class='pointoforder-blacksuit'>♠</span></th><th><span class='pointoforder-redsuit'>♥</span></th><th><span class='pointoforder-blacksuit'>♣</span></th><th><span class='pointoforder-redsuit'>♦</span></th></tr>

				</li>
				<li style="margin: .5em 0;">Take the alphabetic position of the fourth character of the serial number and add/subtract 3 until it’s in the range 3–5. Ranks must alternate between being divisible and not divisible by this number.</li>
				<li style="margin: .5em 0;">Take the alphabetic position of the fifth character of the serial number and add/subtract 3 until it’s in the range 0–2. Call this number <var>x</var>. Ranks of consecutive cards must have a difference of <var>x</var> + 2 or <var>x</var> + 3 (with wraparound allowed).</li>
			</ol>
	
			<p style="margin: .5em 0;">Ranks are considered to be numbered from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King).</p>
	
			<p style="margin: .5em 0;">Only one of the four cards in front of you is valid to play under the two active rules.</p>
