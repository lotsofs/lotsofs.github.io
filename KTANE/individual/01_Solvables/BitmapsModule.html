        <h2>On the Subject of Bitmaps</h2>
        <p class="flavour-text">Over 18 quintillion combinations, only some of them actually matter.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The module displays a bitmap of 64 pixels divided into four “quadrants”. Each pixel is bright (which we call “white” although it may be colored) or dark (“black”).</li>
            <li>There are 4 buttons underneath, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
            <li>In the following table, start at the rule whose number equals the last digit of the serial number</li>
            <li>Keep going through the rules (wrapping around if necessary) until you encounter a condition that applies.</li>
            <li>Calculate the answer for the applicable rule. Repeatedly add or subtract 4 until the answer is between 1 and 4 and press the corresponding button to disarm the module.</li>
        </ul>
