        <h2>On the Subject of Follow the Leader</h2>

        <p class="flavour-text">Child’s play. Just follow the leader. Only if you fail to follow, the penalty is somewhat more explosive.</p>

        <p>This module contains 8-12 wires connecting numerically labeled plugs in a loop.  Each wire leads from one plug to another plug in clockwise order. In this manual, wires are numbered according to the plug they lead from; a wire from plug 1 to plug 2 is considered to be “wire 1”, while a wire from plug 12 to plug 1 is considered to be “wire 12”.</p>

        <p> Progress through the module by first cutting the starting wire, then cutting each applicable wire in the order of the sequence. Each wire will need to be either cut or left uncut based on the state of the previous wire(s) in the sequence. Avoid cutting wires out of sequence.</p>

        <h3>Determining the starting wire</h3>

        <p>Follow the first rule below that applies:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>If an RJ-45 port is present and there is a wire
                leading from plug 4 <em>directly</em> to plug 5, begin at that wire.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug
                matching the number of batteries on the bomb, begin
                with that wire.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug
                matching the first numeral of the serial number,
                begin at that wire.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if there is a lit indicator with the
                label CLR, disregard all further instructions and
                cut all wires present on this module in descending
                numerical order.</li>
            <li>If none of the above apply, the starting wire is the wire earliest in numerical order.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cutting wires</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Always</u> cut the wire at the starting plug. Then progress to the next wire.</li>
            <li>From this position, cut the wires as directed by the steps in the following table.  The starting step corresponds to the first letter in the serial number. If the serial number contains no letters, begin at step A.</li>
            <li>When progressing to the next wire, also progress to the next step alphabetically in the table to determine whether to cut the wire.</li>
            <li>“Previous wire(s)” may refer to wires beyond the original starting position in the sequence.</li>
            <li>If the wire at the starting plug is red, green, or white, progress through the steps in reverse alphabetical order instead.</li>
