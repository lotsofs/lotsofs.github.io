Plan for next stream:
- Can The Good Husband be done after Trevor
- Can Murder clues be discovered by not-Michael and during a mission?

Future notes:
Quick early money if needed for that darn golf course:
* Animal Ark stock from Random Event (100k from instant cashout)
* Some random event that gives 60k
None of these are big cashouts compared to the endgame, and abusing stock market is needed regardless.

==================================
Mission 1: Prologue
- Shoot first 4 cars + foot soldiers.
- The next two regular cop cars can be ignored.
- Shoot the third one again, then upon getting to the car shoot the ones approaching.

- Prologue skip:
1) Make car leak fuel by shooting back tire gas tank
2) Throw car into trigger zone by jumping out
3) Light fuel trail on fire
4) Enter car and hope it gets destroyed during the cutscene.

GOLD MEDAL:
- Mission skips possible. No restrictions.

100%#
Nothing

-------------------
Mission 2: Franklin & Lamar
- Slowing down on the first downhill bit into the canal area to let Lamar catch up
- Seems to be using the character switch menu to abort/prevent dialogue in Simeon's store

GOLD MEDAL
- No DMG
- Ability for 7 seconds (which is 14 in real time?)
- Dont hit the aliens
- Beat Lamar to the race

100%#
Potential Collectibles:
MM #5
-- During initial race. Lord knows
MM #29
-- During initial race. Lord knows
USJ #7
-- Done in all USJs, but tight timing to win the race for Gold
MM #30
-- Probably gets swarmed with cops because you need to stand on a car iirc
USJ #16
-- While waiting for the cops to disappear
USJ #6
-- While waiting for the cops to disappear
MM #1
-- While waiting for the cops to disappear
MM #3
-- While waiting for the cops to disappear, but likely too far out of the way with better options available.


-----------------------
Mission 3: Repossession
- Park car backwards against the fence
- Use car for quicker hop
- Hug the fence, all the way left, and then you can first person push Lamar
- Push him well enough it skips him punching the dude.
- Leaving the garage, climb the small brick wall on the left, seems to spawn all the enemies
- Shooting the pistol to spook Lamar makes him move faster?
- Alley on right, quick Bagger steal.
- Jump off bike at the end to skip something?


GOLD MEDAL:
- 6m30
- 70% accuracy
- 6 headshots
- Shoot the gasoline trail

100%#
Potential Collectibles:
USJ #44
-- Even the any% route does this
MM #50
-- A bit out of the way, and it yields you with not enough speed to do the shortcut jump


---------------
Side Mission 1: Pulling Favors
- Approach junker from the east.
- Return along the west

GOLD MEDAL:
- 5m00
- Dont accidentally unhook

100%#
USJ #17
- Shortest on the route, but an awkward 180 turn required after landing
USJ #25
- out of the way, lines you up faster for end destination, but a bit far
MM #27
- one block further than you're supposed to drive. All of these are awkward, but getting one might be doable. Definitely not two.

----------------------
If you can get the Packie event to spawn? But it's at the cost of doing the stunt over the fence. 
Also should this be completed properly? The destination isn't far (just behind Franklin's house), but it yields 2 stars that must be lost first.

-------------------
Mission 4: Chop
- Push a cart to block Lamar's door (a bit further back) and it teleports him and Chop inside.
- Goes one road further east on the way south for the chase
- Then go straight one further before turning left.
- At the start of the chase, shooting does something? Also later on?
- Cut diagonal northeast over the train tracks. Climb between blue containers.
- Chop can be pushed
- Just cut diagonal and wait for the dude where he falls
- Drive back: right immediately, past Legion Square's tunnel. 


GOLD MEDAL:
- No Van DMG
- Chop POV 10 seconds
- Ability 7 seconds


100%#
LS #16
-- Suboptimal because of the van's slow acceleration
LS #19
-- Suboptimal because of the van's slow acceleration
MM #16
-- Puts you on foot nearby. Tight timing to not lose the chasee
MM #23
-- Puts you on foot practically next to it, while Chop does his thing
USJ #16
-- On a route back, but not on the optimal route. Bottlenecked by dialogue.

----------------------
It might be worth to squash a random event here, each with a minor 1-block detour:
* Security Van 1 (mission ends too close to this, but...)... can take a nearby Peyote plant
* ATM Robbery Sanchez (spawns everywhere, so low priority)
* Mugging 3 (havent been able to get this to spawn yet)
* Getaway Driver, especially if doing it properly


---------------------
Mission 5: Complications
- Take the right car in Simeon's parking lot
- North one block, then west, then onto the main road.
- FPV for running and indoors
- Sneak until out of the bathroom, then just jog in FPV. TPV jump in the little hallway to the garage
- Enter/exit to immediately trigger Michael
- Same route back
- 9 righthanders, 1 kick?


GOLD MEDAL:
- 5m00s
- No damage during Simeon fight
- Knock out the gardener (stealthily)


100%#
USJ #46
-- Somewhat en-route to Michael's.
MM #10
-- To go with the above USJ? 
USJ #7
-- On the way back. Does this work with Michael in the back?
USJ #8
-- Very unlikely
USJ #44
-- Already done, likely.

----------------------
Quick save and load glitch to Michael's house
Alternatively squish a ? or Random Event before doing this.
Hold the phone open and walk left to avoid a cutscene trigger

---------------------
Mission 6: Father/Son
- Franklin hops on the boat after entering the tunnel
- Shoot a guy on the turn right?
- Slow down a LOT now
- Jimmy gets poled before an underpass. 
- Caught Jimmy and shot before the end of an onramp
- Franklin caught before the last drop
- Dialogue is bottlenecking the garage


GOLD MEDAL:
- Rescue Jimmy in 10s
- No damage (after pay n spray?)

100%#
MM #40
-- Out of the way
MM #44
-- On the way but access to the graveyard is awkward
LS #18
-- On the way but access to the graveyard is awkward
USJ #28
-- Likely not ideal with the boat spawn
USJ #9
-- Likely not ideal with the boat spawn
MM #46
-- Alternative route from any%
MM #43
-- Alternative route from any%
MM #29
-- Detour from alternative route, good for setup to USJ 9
MM #19
-- While waiting for dialogue to end. There's a PP nearby, so not ideal for om1
MM #50
-- Out of the way
USJ #46
-- Seems like a bigger detour than the previous mission
MM #10
-- See above

------------------
Does some weird wallcover warp setup
Also some weird phonecall thing
Drive off and warp back to the house
Potentially get MM #17 and warp back from there
Or maybe even a side mission, like Paparazzo, though it is much further away

------------------
Mission 7: Marriage Counseling
- Holding the phone open prevents call & enemies?

GOLD MEDAL:
- No damage
- 5m30s
- Kill 3 enemies from inside the car

100%#
MM #17
-- On the way? Not really

--------------------
This drops you in a random park with no vehicle.
Options: 
Follow the highway to Lester's house ala any%
Along the way is MM #24
Maybe USJ #24 followed by Security Van 10, Luring GIrl Into Alley, or LS #13
LS #16 in the nearby construction site
LS #19 followed by Mugging 2
Humans of Los Santos - Mani
MM #2 but it's behind a wall I think
Gang Intimidations random event is right next to Lester's house. Small detour. No luck at spawning
Murder Mystery Clue #3
This unlocks the timer for Amanda's The Good Husband. It probably needs to be taken before Trevor
What is Franklin up to?

------------------
Mission 8: Friend Request
- Jump off into marker
- No longer commits sudok
- Rapid FP-TPV switching does something??
- Store vehicle in garage?

GOLD MEDAL:
- 8m30s
- 32 seconds for the popups

100%#
Gold medal only allows for about 1 minute of detouring on this mission.
-- Might wanna do stock market stuff with this
MM #2
-- Behind a wall?
LS #19
-- On the way??
LS #21
-- On the way??
MM #48
-- On the way??
USJ #48
-- On the way pretty much
MM #46
-- A bit detour I think?

----------------------------
This unlocks Chaos
Next mission is unlocked simply by running past the swimming pool into the hedge

----------------------------
Mission 9: Daddy's Little Girl
- Push Jimmy a bit off the stairs
- Then lure him into the car, enter passenger
- Push red bike out of the way
- There is some sort of bhop strat? If not, take yellow bike
- No need to dive without the waves?

GOLD MEDAL:
- Top speed on seashark
- Dont fall off bike
- 1m00 to swim to the boat

100%#
LS #11
-- Under the road, probably bad. Might wanna do it when you can deathwarp or something
MM #45
-- Seems good
LS #9
-- Requires getting off the bike, voiding the gold medal

------------------------------
Any% QS warps at this point, grabs the suit, then hangwarps franklin to drive to Lester in sleep mode.
Need to do Chaos at this point to not miss it. If it's even required.
Get LS 12 and MM 18on the pier.
The underwater PP doesn't seem worth it. It spawns next to a nuclear barrel.
Jesse spawns down the pier, but no car to get there.
Also need to ride the coasters etc?
Can take USJ 9 on the way to chaos, and maybe MM 39 and 5 (both bit out of the way)
Will want to get Good Husband out of the way too at some point. This puts you at Michael's house -> No need for QS warp.

----------------------------
Mission 10: Casing the Jewel Store
- Run FPS to the store, hug the left wall. One hop then in TPS.
- TPS out of the shop, FPS to the car
- Block car door upon exit
- Ladders're done TPS. Roof FPS, upper roof TPS too.
- Vent FPS. Jump down TPS before the round building on right side
- Way back goes highway drop into tunnel, then the train tracks sewer. 
- Jump out into marker
- Any% picks Eddie Toh, Gustavo Mota, Paige Harris (all defaults)

GOLD MEDAL:
- 8m00
- All three thigns in one picture

100%#
LS #13
-- On the way, but maybe better opportunity later with faster car
USJ #46
-- This drive is done like hundreds of times
MM #10
-- This drive is done like hundreds of times already
USJ #18
on the way back, parallel road. Awkward with bridge at the end to get to Lester's

-----------------------------------
Mission 11: Carbine Rifles
- Through the parking tunnel
- Past Pay N Spray onto tracks
- Grass hill on left
- Keep left wall, camp by home in barrier on the road
- Lester's text means go. Franklin call?
- Park between 2 bridges near each other, then run back. SHoot floor?
- Shoot floro in front of FBI car.
- Let driver get out and shoot him last
- Same route back. Go GO GO.

GOLD MEDAL:
- 2m00 to lose wanted level

100%#
Nothing

--------------------------------------
Mission 12: The Jewel Store Job
- Sanchez: Sharp left
- Don't go over the overpass. Keep left, big'ish road.
- Drop down onto highway by that park, they will enter tunnels. Keep your sights on them with the camera button.
- Drive blindly. At some point turn left and hop into the drain.
- Hitting the trigger fails the mission. Is this ok for gold?
- Truck: After second underpass cross river. Keep driving diagonally or curb boosting.
- Ignore everything.

GOLD MEDAL:
- 0m50s to leave store
- Don't die during the sewer chase
- Steal EVERYTHING

100%#
Same initial drive as always. Van now. Not worth shit.
Nothing in the tunnel it seems.
Truck's slow

-----------------------------------
This drops you at the porn club. Exit FPS.
Might wanna do a random event.
Otherwise, Drive to Long Stretch.
